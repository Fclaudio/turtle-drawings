# Drawings 
These are a set of drawing generated using the Turtle - Python Library

# New Behavior
This was intended to use the existin gTurtle libre and apply some object oriented strategies to create additional behaviour for the turtles. 
In my case it was to implement a Follower and Runner in which the main turtle would randomly run accross the screen trying to escape, while the 
other ones tried to catch up to it. If the followers caught up to the runner an circle would appear on the screen.
